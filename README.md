I'm excited to share the successful launch of the "Database Schema Design" project during my internship with Softapper Tech Solutions!
As part of the team, I designed a robust database schema tailored for a specific application domain. 
This included identifying entities, relationships, and attributes, and defining appropriate data types and constraints. 
I also normalized the database schema to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. 
This project has been an excellent opportunity to refine my skills in database design and work with a talented group of professionals. 
Let's continue building innovative solutions together! ðŸ’¡ðŸŽ‰
